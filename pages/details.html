                    There are various way you can create and manage a website. Basically, a website is created by HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL and many more. While you create the structure of your webpage using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), and then add styling by using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). You may add some other behaviour in your webpage by using scripting language such as Javascript. This way, you can create a website. For this you may need a coding skill of basic programming.<br><br>

                    On the other hand you can use some online tools to create a website, for instance Elementor. Also, Wordpress (A CMS: Content Management System) will help you to create a website. <br><hr><br>

                    <span class="sCaps"><b>Back</b></span> on how I have created this Website. Well, as I have basic skill of computer programming, I decieded to choose the first path. Which is do code to build a website. I have learnt HTML from w3school.com. Now I am learning CSS from this website. I have learnt some basic Javascript function and method which helped me built this website. <br><br>

                    At first I have created the structure of my web page, the main page actually. Then I have added some style in it. Later, I created some other pages, and then linked them with homepage. I have added some practice tasks, such as <a href="/practices/htmlJavascript.html" target="_blank">A Taste of Javascript</a> where you may see a few touch of Javascript. <br><br>

                    One of my friend helped me to get the hosting space. This site is hosted from a shared hosting space. Are you looking for free host? You can host your website for free using Google Drive. There is lots of tutorials available on internet. There is also some free hosting service provider available. I would recommened Netlify. You can host your website from there site, with a custom sub-domain. <br><br>

                    Then I have bought a domain from Piprahost. It is a Bangladeshi site.<br>
                    For me, the benefits is that:

                        <li>Payment can be done through mobile banking such as bKash.</li>
                        <li>Other payment method is also availeable.</li>
